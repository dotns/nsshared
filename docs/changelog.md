Added the public-edge upstream TLS re-encryption wire contract.

- Add an optional `GatewayHttpRoute.upstream_tls` policy for HTTPS NSN-backed
  backends.
- Added the gateway capability scope used to gate b-lite support during rollout.
- Added serde compatibility coverage proving old payloads without
  `upstream_tls` default to plaintext behavior.
- Verification passed with `just qa`.

Added the GatewayEgress selected-owner route hint.

- `ServiceBackendKind::GatewayEgress` now carries an optional
  `selected_gateway_id` field so NSD can project the gateway owner selected for
  a gateway-owned service VIP.
- The field is byte-additive: legacy payloads without the field deserialize to
  `None`, and routes without an owner omit the field when serialized.
- Verification passed with `just qa`.
